        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Melissa Sanders. I am twenty-four years old and residing in Orlando, Florida. I am a graphic designer aspiring to translate my passion into UX/UI design. I work a full-time job while balancing school and my social life. My weeks are often hectic, and I look forward to creating downtime to indulge in activities like reading a good book, working out, baking sweet treats, and spending time with my fiancé and two adorable cats.</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in rural Wisconsin, where I spent much of my time outdoors or making art. After high school, I moved away to Massachusetts to live with my fiancé and fell in love with the coastal views and colonial living. While in Massachusetts, I found the urge to explore more of what the world offers. I moved south to Florida after the height of the pandemic, looking for a change in scenery to fuel my passion. My passion for design started when I was in elementary school. I loved arts and crafts classes and was always optimistic about my work. My favorite projects to make in class involved using uncommon materials to create art. My most memorable project was making pictures using macaroni art. I enjoy making pottery and experimenting with color theory. I am always looking for ways to get fully involved in my work and am not afraid of getting my hands dirty. I found great pleasure in presenting my work to family and friends and received praise from my teachers and peers for each project I did. I have found deep connections in my art with my love for the beauty and chaos of nature.</p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>I aim to create a unique experience for web users while maintaining an eye-pleasing and engaging interface. I am meticulous and appreciate it when the design flow is adequate and practical. I envision my future works to be optimal for user experience while looking extravagant and engaging. To reach these goals, I am continuing my education for a bachelor's degree in graphic design with a focus on UX/UI design.</p>
