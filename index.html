        <div class="who">
          <p>When I'm not immersed in design projects, I indulge in my various hobbies. I enjoy getting lost in a good book, bringing vibrant ideas to life through painting, crafting intricate crochet pieces, baking delicious treats, and engaging in crafting adventures.
            <br><br>A large portion of my inspiration comes from my time spent in nature. I frequently walk and take trips to the beach with my fiancé, where I feel at peace. Inspiration for my work is spontaneous. I keep personal notes of the things I want to create when they come to me and often indulge in the beauty of nature. Most of my favorite works to make are acrylic pour paints. These paintings allow me to create abstract blends of colors that create beautiful designs.
            <br><br>I believe that the blend of my skills in design and my diverse creative interests allows me to bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake. I'm excited to continue growing and evolving in the dynamic UX/UI Design field. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>
